**new:**

- _(maya)_ Artist can now choose to load multiple references of the same subset at once [PYPE-646, PYPS-81]
- _(nuke)_ Option to use named OCIO colorspaces for review colour baking. [PYPS-82]
- _(pype)_ Pype can now work with `master` versions for publishing and loading. These are non-versioned publishes that are overwritten with the latest version during publish. These are now supported in all the GUIs, but their publishing is deactivated by default. [PYPE-653]
- _(blender)_ Added support for basic blender workflow. We currently support `rig`, `model` and `animation` families. [PYPE-768]

- _(nuke)_ Bookmark to current context is now added automatically to all nuke browser windows. [PYPE-712]

**change:**

- _(maya)_ It is now possible to publish camera without. baking. Keep in mind that unbaked cameras can't be guaranteed to work in other hosts. [PYPE-595]
- _(maya)_ All the renders from maya are now grouped in the loader by their Layer name. [PYPE-482]
- _(nuke/hiero)_ Any publishes from nuke and hiero can now be versioned independently of the workfile. [PYPE-728]


**fix:**

- _(nuke)_ Mixed slashes caused issues in ocio config path.
- _(pype)_ Intent field in pyblish GUI was passing label instead of value to ftrack. [PYPE-733]
- _(nuke)_ Publishing of pre-renders was inconsistent. [PYPE-766]

- _(nuke)_ Nuke was crashing if it ran into certain missing knobs. For example DPX output missing `autocrop` [PYPE-774]
- _(deadline)_ Project overrides were not working properly with farm render publishing.
- _(hiero)_ Problems with single frame plates publishing.
- _(maya)_ Redshift RenderPass token were breaking render publishing. [PYPE-778]
- _(nuke)_ Build first workfile was not accepting jpeg sequences.
- _(maya)_ Multipart (Multilayer) EXRs were breaking review publishing due to FFMPEG incompatiblity [PYPE-781]

## 2.6.0 ##

_**release date:** 9 March 2020_

**change:**
- _(maya)_ render publishing has been simplified and made more robust. Render setup layers are now automatically added to publishing subsets and `render globals` family has been replaced with simple `render` [PYPE-570]
- _(avalon)_ change context and workfiles apps, have been merged into one, that allows both actions to be performed at the same time. [PYPE-747]
- _(pype)_ thumbnails are now automatically propagate to asset from the last published subset in the loader
- _(ftrack)_ publishing comment and intent are now being published to ftrack note as well as describtion. [PYPE-727]
- _(pype)_ when overriding existing version new old representations are now overriden, instead of the new ones just being appended. (to allow this behaviour, the version validator need to be disabled. [PYPE-690])
- _(pype)_ burnin preset has been significantly simplified. It now doesn't require passing function to each field, but only need the actual text template. to use this, all the current burnin PRESETS MUST BE UPDATED for all the projects.
- _(ftrack)_ credentials are now stored on a per server basis, so it's possible to switch between ftrack servers without having to log in and out. [PYPE-723]


**new:**
- _(pype)_ production and development deployments now have different colour of the tray icon. Orange for Dev and Green for production [PYPE-718]
- _(maya)_ renders can now be attached to a publishable subset rather than creating their own subset. For example it is possible to create a reviewable `look` or `model` render and have it correctly attached as a representation of the subsets [PYPE-451]
- _(maya)_ after saving current scene into a new context (as a new shot for instance), all the scene publishing subsets data gets re-generated automatically to match the new context [PYPE-532]

- _(pype)_ validator that prevent accidental overwrites of previously published versions. [PYPE-680]

- _(maya)_ added validator to make sure that relative paths are used when publishing arnold standins.
- _(nukestudio)_ it is now possible to extract and publish audio family from clip in nuke studio [PYPE-682]

**fix**:

- _(ftrack)_ sync to avalon was sometime crashing when ran on empty project
- _(nukestudio)_ publishing same shots after they've been previously archived/deleted would result in a crash. [PYPE-737]
- _(nuke)_ slate workflow was breaking in certain scenarios. [PYPE-730]
- _(pype)_ rendering publish workflow has been significantly improved to prevent error resulting from implicit render collection. [PYPE-665, PYPE-746]
- _(pype)_ launching application on a non-synced project resulted in obscure [PYPE-528]
- _(pype)_ missing keys in burnins no longer result in an error. [PYPE-706]
- _(ftrack)_ create folder structure action was sometimes failing for project managers due to wrong permissions.
- _(Nukestudio)_ using `source` in the start frame tag could result in wrong frame range calculation
- _(ftrack)_ sync to avalon action and event have been improved by catching more edge cases and provessing them properly.
